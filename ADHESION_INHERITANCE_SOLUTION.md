# Adhesion Inheritance Solution

## Problem Statement

The original adhesion system had multiple issues:
1. When a parent cell split into two children, an adhesion connection was created between them, but when either child split again, the existing adhesion between siblings was not removed
2. The `parentMakeAdhesion` boolean was being ignored due to a bug in the adhesion creation logic
3. Adhesion rendering and physics were not checking the `parentMakeAdhesion` setting from the associated mode

## Solution Overview

I implemented a comprehensive solution that:
1. **Tracks parent cells** that created each adhesion
2. **Automatically deactivates adhesions** when either child splits
3. **Fixes the `parentMakeAdhesion` boolean** to properly control adhesion creation
4. **Ensures all adhesion systems respect** the `parentMakeAdhesion` setting

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Enhanced AdhesionConnection Structure

Modified the `AdhesionConnection` structure to include a `parentID` field:

```cpp
struct AdhesionConnection {
    int cellIndexA;     // Index of the first cell in the connection
    int cellIndexB;     // Index of the second cell in the connection
    int modeIndex;      // Mode index for the connection
    bool isActive;      // Whether the connection is currently active
    int parentID;       // ID of the parent cell that created this adhesion
};
```

### 2. Fixed Adhesion Creation Logic

Fixed the bug in `cell_update_internal.comp` where `parentMakeAdhesion` was being ignored:

```glsl
// BEFORE (broken):
if (mode.parentMakeAdhesion || true) {

// AFTER (fixed):
if (mode.parentMakeAdhesion) {
```

### 3. Adhesion Deactivation on Cell Splitting

Added logic to deactivate existing adhesions when a cell splits:

```glsl
// Deactivate any existing adhesions involving this cell (when it splits)
for (uint i = 0; i < adhesionCount; i++) {
    AdhesionConnection existingAdhesion = connections[i];
    if (existingAdhesion.isActive == 1 && 
        (existingAdhesion.cellAIndex == index || existingAdhesion.cellBIndex == index)) {
        connections[i].isActive = 0; // Deactivate the adhesion
    }
}
```

### 4. Mode-Based Adhesion Rendering and Physics

**Adhesion Line Rendering**: Now checks the mode's `parentMakeAdhesion` setting before rendering:

```glsl
// Check if the mode that created this adhesion has parentMakeAdhesion enabled
GPUMode mode = modes[currentAdhesion.modeIndex];
if (!mode.parentMakeAdhesion) {
    return; // Skip rendering if parentMakeAdhesion is false
}
```

**Adhesion Physics**: Now checks the mode's `parentMakeAdhesion` setting before applying forces:

```glsl
// Check if the mode that created this adhesion has parentMakeAdhesion enabled
GPUMode mode = modes[connection.modeIndex];
if (!mode.parentMakeAdhesion) {
    return; // Skip physics if parentMakeAdhesion is false
}
```

### 5. Compacted Adhesion Line Rendering

Implemented a compacted approach for adhesion line rendering to ensure only active adhesions are processed:

- Added active adhesion counter buffer
- Used atomic operations for compacted indices
- Clear line buffer before each extraction
- Use active count for rendering

## Files Modified

### Core Structures
- `src/simulation/cell/common_structs.h` - Added `parentID` to `AdhesionConnection`

### Compute Shaders
- `shaders/cell/physics/cell_update_internal.comp` - Fixed adhesion creation logic and added deactivation
- `shaders/cell/physics/adhesion_physics.comp` - Added mode structure and parentMakeAdhesion check
- `shaders/rendering/debug/adhesion_line_extract.comp` - Added mode structure, parentMakeAdhesion check, and compacted rendering

### C++ Implementation
- `src/simulation/cell/cell_manager.cpp` - Updated buffer bindings and added debug functions
- `src/simulation/cell/cell_manager.h` - Added debug function declarations

## Behavior

### When `parentMakeAdhesion = true`:
1. **Cell splits** → Adhesion created between children
2. **Either child splits** → Original adhesion deactivated, new adhesion created for new siblings
3. **Adhesion lines render** and **physics forces apply**

### When `parentMakeAdhesion = false`:
1. **Cell splits** → No adhesion created
2. **No adhesion lines render**
3. **No adhesion physics forces apply**

## Benefits

1. **Complete Control**: The `parentMakeAdhesion` boolean now fully controls all aspects of adhesion behavior
2. **Correct Inheritance**: Adhesions are properly removed when cells split
3. **Efficient**: Uses simple index-based tracking without complex parent-child trees
4. **GPU-Friendly**: All logic runs on GPU with minimal CPU overhead
5. **Performance**: Only active adhesions with enabled modes are processed

## Testing

To verify the solution works:

1. **Set `parentMakeAdhesion = false`** → No adhesions should appear when cells split
2. **Set `parentMakeAdhesion = true`** → Adhesions should appear between siblings
3. **Let either child split** → Original adhesion should disappear, new adhesion should appear between new siblings
4. **Check console output** for debug information about adhesion state

The solution ensures that adhesion behavior is completely controlled by the `parentMakeAdhesion` setting and follows proper biological inheritance patterns.
